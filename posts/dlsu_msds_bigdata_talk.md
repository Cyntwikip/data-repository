## DLSU Master of Science in Data Science Big Data Talk

We just had our first Big Data talk for the inaugural cohort of the Master of Science in Data Science program at De La Salle University. This talk was part of the Big Data and Scalable Computing course, which I am currently spearheading. In this course, we tackle data engineering, cloud concepts, parallel computing, data orchestration, and more.

A big thank you to Sir Reymart Canuel, Senior Principal Engineer at Kollab, for being our esteemed speaker. Sir Rey delivered a comprehensive talk on big data, covering the current landscape and opportunities. He showcased architectures using AWS and GCP for various use cases and even conducted a cool demo utilizing some of these tools. We truly learned a lot from this session!
