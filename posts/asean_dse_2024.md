## ASEAN Data Science Explorers Finals 2024

Recently visited the ASEAN Data Science Explorers Competition Philippines National Finals at De La Salle University! 

Last year, as an ASEAN Data Science Ambassador for the ASEAN Foundation, I had the opportunity to upskill hundreds of ASEAN youths from various countries through workshops, and it was rewarding to see many of my mentees/students reach the finals. 

It was great to reconnect with Ilan Asqolani, the Program Manager for this competition, this year â€“ and thank you for the thoughtful gift!
