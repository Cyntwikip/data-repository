## Ateneo Grad School Ethics Talk

Talking about AI, its ethics, and its impact on the workforce are critical and controversial topics, especially now that we are in the age of Generative AI. I recently had the opportunity to address this at an event hosted by the Ateneo Graduate School of Business, where I delivered a talk titled "The Rise of AI: Will My Job Be Affected?"

During my talk, I discussed the current AI landscape, focusing not just on the technology itself but also on its limitations, ethical considerations, and real-world use cases. These are crucial aspects to consider as AI continues to evolve and influence our lives.

We also held a panel discussion on the broader implications of AI on politics, governance, education, and the labor market. The diverse perspectives highlighted just how multifaceted and complex AI’s impact can be.

I’m also glad to have shared the floor with my co-speaker and panelist, Josh Bosiños. Engaging with a forward-looking audience, alongside a knowledgeable peer, made this event truly enriching. Conversations like these are essential as we collectively navigate the opportunities and challenges that AI presents.
