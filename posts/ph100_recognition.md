## PH100 Brightest Minds Under 30 Recognition

I have been selected for the PH100 2024 by StellarPH. 🥳

Honored to be recognized alongside such inspiring individuals as one of the brightest and most ambitious minds in the Philippines under 30. 🚀 From leading national-scale data and AI initiatives to pioneering data science programs at De La Salle University and upskilling and mentoring thousands across the Philippines and the ASEAN region, it’s been an incredible journey contributing to both the country’s and the region’s digital transformation. Grateful for the support of my mentors, colleagues, students, and collaborators who have helped make this possible!

Special thanks to the incredible organizations I’ve been part of that have provided the platforms to create real impact. Now that I have returned to ADB, I’m excited to continue driving change and making an even greater impact across the entire region.

It's also amazing to see one of my students and a past intern on the list—congratulations to you! 🎉 So proud of your growth and all that you’ve accomplished. Alyssa Casandra Wee 

A special thank you to Pjotr Steinmetz, Tino Zwirs, and the rest of the StellarPH team for this incredible recognition and for creating a platform that celebrates young leaders. 

Can’t wait to meet everyone at the Celebration Night! 🙌🏼
