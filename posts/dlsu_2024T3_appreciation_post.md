## DLSU AY2023-2024 T3 Appreciation Post

As the school year has ended, I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my students from the Big Data and Scalable Computing course—the inaugural cohort of the MS Data Science program—and the Data Mining and Statistics course for Data Science minors at De La Salle University.

In Big Data, we explored data engineering comprehensively, diving into cloud concepts and tools like AWS, ETL processes, parallel computing, and data orchestration. In Data Mining, we covered web scraping, data preprocessing, regular expressions, statistics, machine learning, association rule learning, and recommender systems.

This term was particularly special as it marked my first time juggling both postgrad and undergrad teaching. Being a professor is not just about imparting knowledge but also about connecting with students and empowering them to reach their full potential. It was a truly memorable and rewarding experience. A special thanks to all of my students for the fun birthday presents—they brightened my entire birth week! Enjoy the well-deserved break. I look forward to seeing you all in the next school year!

As we advance in data science and technology, how do you think innovations in big data, data engineering, data mining, and machine learning will shape the future of education and upskilling?
