## ADB Singapore AI Hackathon

Still on a high from the recent hackathon at Microsoft Singapore! This event gave us the perfect opportunity to address a real pain point in our organization. Collaborating closely with key stakeholders, architects, and engineers from ADB, Microsoft, KPMG, and other industry leaders, we developed a prototype in just two days—turning ideas into a tangible solution using cutting-edge frameworks and LLMs. It was incredible to see what we could achieve together in such a short time. 

I started participating in hackathons and competitions a decade ago, and before taking a hiatus as a participant in recent years, I had been in over 50. Since then, I’ve transitioned to mentoring and judging, helping the new generation of developers and startup teams. So, it felt great to jump back in and actually participate. It really reignited the ‘hacker’ in me! 

This experience reinforced the power of collaboration and innovation—two key drivers in solving complex challenges and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Huge thanks to Kadra Saeed, Ozzeir Khan, and the rest of the team for their guidance and support throughout the process!
