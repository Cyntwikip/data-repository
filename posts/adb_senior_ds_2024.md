## ADB Senior Data Science Officer 2024

I'm excited to share that I'm returning to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as a Senior Data Science Officer! I originally joined ADB back in 2019 as an artificial intelligence consultant, and I'm thrilled to rejoin the team and contribute to its artificial intelligence and data science initiatives.
