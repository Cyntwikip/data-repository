## PUP ECE Talk

I had the pleasure of speaking at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Electronics Engineering Society's event last month, where I discussed the wonders and limitations of AI, and the crucial role electronics practitioners play in this field.

It was encouraging to see over 600 participants in attendance, filling the cinema venue. Thank you to everyone who joined and contributed to the event's success, and a special thanks to Sir Gerhard Tan for inviting me.

On a related note, I used the Samsung Galaxy AI feature to easily remove a bag from the pictureâ€”though it did make my hand look a bit strange! This is a perfect example of how AI can be both impressive and imperfect, echoing the very points I made during the talk.
