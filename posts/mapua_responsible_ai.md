## Mapua Responsible AI Talk

I recently had the honor of speaking at Mapúa University's Inter-School Organizations Summit about the safe and responsible use of AI. During my talk, I discussed the various applications and limitations of AI, emphasizing the importance of understanding its capabilities and constraints.

A significant portion of my discussion was dedicated to ethical frameworks, where I outlined the principles that should guide AI development and deployment. I also shared essential guidelines for responsible AI use, stressing the need for transparency, fairness, and sustainability.

Thank you to Angela Cardano and the Honor Society of Mapúa for the opportunity to engage in this critical conversation about the future of AI!
