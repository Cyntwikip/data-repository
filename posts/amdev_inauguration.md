## DLSU Advanced Manufacturing Technologies Executive Diploma Program Inauguration

I am honored to be part of the inauguration of the Advanced Manufacturing Technologies Executive Diploma program at De La Salle University's School of Lifelong Learning, in partnership with USAID and Unilab Foundation, Inc. This program is designed to equip C-level executives, Presidents, VPs, and Directors of companies in the advanced manufacturing sector with cutting-edge Industry 4.0 skills over the course of one year.

Together with my colleague, Sashmir Yap, I will be teaching the Big Data Analytics course to these industry leaders. This course focuses on Big Data, Data Science, and AI in the context of manufacturing to drive innovation and efficiency within organizations.

On a personal note, I had the chance to have a quick catch-up with my former classmate, now mentor and friend, Allan Timonera. Allan, who is the President of Fastech Synergy, continues to inspire and guide me in this journey. 

Looking forward to the transformation of the advanced manufacturing sector in the Philippines! 🌐📊🚀
