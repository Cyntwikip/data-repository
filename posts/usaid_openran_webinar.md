## USAID Open RAN Webinar

A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to be a resource speaker on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning during the USAID webinar on Advancing Open RAN in Asia. It was an honor to share insights and discuss the transformative potential of AI/ML with over 600 participants.

Thank you, Richard Matias and Asia Open RAN Academy, for giving me the opportunity to share about artificial intelligence. Let's continue pushing the boundaries of technology for a brighter future!
