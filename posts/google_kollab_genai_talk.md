## Google Kollab Generative AI Talk

Had a great time discussing the potential of Generative AI and best practices for adoption by Philippine companies with fellow AI and data experts from both the private and public sectors. 

Grateful to Senti AI and Kollab for organizing this insightful event and for the opportunity to share the panel with Sebastian Iba√±ez, Deputy Chief at the Center for AI Research, and Kenneth Molina, Lead Data Scientist at Smart Communications. Special thanks to Ralph Vincent Regalado, CEO of Senti AI, for moderating the discussion. 

Exciting times ahead as we explore how AI can drive innovation and growth in our country!
