## NEDA FY 2023 Innovation Grant Recipient

Our project has been chosen as one of the recipients of the NEDA FY 2023 Innovation Grants, securing funding from the National Innovation Council (NIC) Executive Technical Board! We‚Äôre proud to be among the 25 innovation projects funded, with a total of PHP 100 million awarded. üéâ 

‚ÄúThese projects cover a wide range of fields‚Äîfrom agri-tech solutions and AR/VR education platforms to smart data-driven policies, disaster preparedness, and cultural heritage preservation‚Äîshowcasing the creativity of Filipino innovation actors as well as the vibrant and dynamic landscape of innovation across all regions.‚Äù

I've always wanted to do something big for the community. One way I‚Äôve pursued this is through educating and mentoring the future of our country, something I‚Äôve been passionate about as a professor at De La Salle University. Thank you, DLSU, for giving me this opportunity to co-pioneer and develop data science programs for the past five years.

Another avenue is by developing policies or recommendations that can potentially benefit everyone in the country. Fortunately, just over a year ago, I was asked by DAP‚Äôs President to lead this national-scale initiative with the goal of making data access and analysis easier for everyone‚Äîboth the government and the public. What began with just three of us developing the prototype has now grown to a team of fourteen, and we couldn‚Äôt be prouder. Thanks again to everyone who has been part of this journey!

Last year, we had a successful product demo of our data platform for various government agencies, including the Presidential Communications Office, the Department of Science and Technology, and the Development Academy of the Philippines. This milestone wouldn't have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our amazing high-caliber team. Now, with this grant, we're scaling things up even further to bring our vision to life.

We‚Äôre excited about what‚Äôs ahead and can‚Äôt wait to make this platform available to the public in the coming months and years.
