## PH100 Awards Night

An unforgettable night celebrating with the PH100—some of the brightest minds under 30, each driven to make a real impact! It’s humbling to be recognized alongside this inspiring group and especially glad to reconnect with former students, interns, friends, fellow founders, and community leads who also received the award.

Reflecting on a journey that’s seen me leading AI initiatives across Asia, building data science programs, and upskilling thousands has been a reminder of why we do what we do. Huge thanks to Pjotr Steinmetz, Tino Zwirs, and the StellarPH team for the honor and for putting together a night dedicated to innovation and ambition. Here’s to all the bold ideas and collaborations to come!
