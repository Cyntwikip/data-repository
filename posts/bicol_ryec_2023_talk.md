## Bicol 9th Regional Youth Entrepreneurship Congress

🎤 Recently had the pleasure of speaking at the 9th Regional Youth Entrepreneurship Congress event in Bicol, Philippines, organized by the Camsur Chamber of Industry and Commerce! 🇵🇭 My topic: "Artificial Intelligence and Innovation." 🤖💡

💫 Among a remarkable lineup of entrepreneurs, celebrities, and influencers, I brought a unique perspective to the stage as an AI expert! 🚀

💡While my fellow speakers shared their entrepreneurial wisdom, I had the privilege to dive into the realm of AI and its transformative impact on innovation and entrepreneurship. 🌟 Thanks to the 3000 participants who joined us for this enlightening journey. 👥

I want to give a special shoutout to my fellow speakers:
Rhoda Castro Caliwara- Host of NegoSHEnte, Founder and President
Andrew Gan - Actor and Entrepreneur
Ralph Layco - Founder and Chief Marketing Officer

Really enjoyed our conversations. I learned so much from your personal experiences and the diversity of your perspectives as successful entrepreneurs/celebrities. As someone who primarily sees things from the lens of science and technology, it was an enlightening experience.

I also wanted to thank the Camsur Chamber for this opportunity. Not only was I able to impart my knowledge about AI and inspire young individuals, but I was also able to gain mentors and friends (my fellow speakers).
