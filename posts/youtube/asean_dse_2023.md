00:00:02.959 okay let's start hi again
00:00:06.299 um I am sharing
00:00:09.360 my Slidell
00:00:13.740 just I want to have an idea about this
00:00:16.320 equipment
00:00:18.240 let's see
00:00:20.400 please join
00:00:39.559 still no participants can you see it
00:00:43.020 hello
00:00:51.000 yes I can see it but still joining one
00:00:53.399 moment
00:01:05.099 foreign
00:01:11.540 how about the others still no
00:01:14.460 participants yeah that's right maybe
00:01:17.240 just some internet issues
00:01:28.740 and see the pool is title
00:01:31.200 well that is
00:01:33.840 producer.com
00:01:40.920 you can't see the pole inside but okay
00:01:42.720 okay it might be an error on violent
00:01:45.000 well done
00:01:50.939 we can't see
00:01:52.700 someone was able to access it visible
00:01:55.619 that's very good might be some slider
00:01:58.200 button yeah
00:02:09.119 mostly technical people
00:02:16.580 computer science okay this is a very
00:02:20.580 technical crowd
00:02:33.420 business
00:02:41.720 [Music]
00:02:44.940 agriculture interesting
00:02:50.340 and shift into Tech yeah
00:02:53.819 I think we can proceed down for the next
00:02:55.140 one thank you thank you for this okay uh
00:02:57.680 based in
00:02:59.580 not even most people here are from the
00:03:01.500 Philippines but yeah in my previous runs
00:03:03.900 I had many participants from other
00:03:05.280 countries as well
00:03:08.540 from Indonesia
00:03:10.680 please have pictures so much in Cambodia
00:03:12.840 now Pinay Malaysia from everyone as soon
00:03:16.620 basically
00:03:23.099 okay
00:03:32.819 do you think that's it no more response
00:03:40.159 less responses now okay
00:03:44.159 okay next question which university are
00:03:47.040 you studying at
00:03:52.200 I would expect Mozart from dlse is quite
00:03:55.140 a few of my students are here
00:03:57.180 but my previous run
00:03:58.799 um it was like mostly yeah no
00:04:00.780 participant from the lrc somewhere from
00:04:02.819 Ateneo from other countries it's a mix
00:04:06.900 yeah my last one was most non-dialist
00:04:09.659 people
00:04:17.339 this is actually my fifth enablement
00:04:19.680 session
00:04:27.780 first three are on site here and we'll
00:04:30.300 receive the fourth one is virtual this
00:04:33.120 one is very close one
00:04:39.300 okay
00:04:41.040 yeah and finally do you have a
00:04:43.320 background in data science for Analytics
00:05:02.280 foreign
00:05:04.800 excuse me the ball isn't showing on the
00:05:07.500 slider website weird yeah slider is
00:05:11.520 acting up right now
00:05:13.520 that's weird let's let's see if it works
00:05:16.080 now
00:05:16.800 you might have to like do
00:05:19.800 back and forth yeah it's working now I
00:05:21.720 just have to do that back and forth
00:05:24.240 and it's like it was weird
00:05:28.139 I've been using this for many years now
00:05:29.820 actually
00:05:30.900 um since I started teaching here at USU
00:05:33.539 four years ago and normally it works
00:05:35.940 later it's really stable
00:05:37.800 I think this is the first time that I
00:05:39.900 had these issues with style
00:05:43.139 okay
00:05:46.039 half roughly half
00:05:51.840 okay great well in any case if you don't
00:05:54.600 know much about analytics that's okay
00:05:56.460 because I will introduce you to anime
00:05:57.900 effects if you already know that then um
00:06:00.720 you might find the
00:06:03.180 um sap component more helpful to you
00:06:05.820 because you already know what the
00:06:06.780 foundations of Analytics
00:06:08.639 all right thank you for that thank you
00:06:10.080 for this now I have a better idea about
00:06:11.940 this chord
00:06:15.000 yeah and what do you want to get out of
00:06:16.740 this session let's see
00:06:22.380 might have to do this again for it to
00:06:25.440 work
00:06:27.600 back and forth
00:06:35.699 it's stuck again okay let me try that
00:06:38.039 again yeah slider is acting up right now
00:06:45.180 let's see
00:06:56.400 is it working okay now it is
00:07:13.139 learned about sound yeah which you will
00:07:15.960 be using for the competition if you will
00:07:18.539 participate
00:07:24.660 yeah this session will be quite high
00:07:27.599 level so if you don't have
00:07:29.699 much technical experience you can do
00:07:32.520 this
00:07:38.639 okay
00:07:46.680 what else
00:07:56.039 yeah I think
00:07:57.840 that's it thank you for this okay
00:08:01.139 so once again I am your Ambassador for
00:08:04.740 this enablement session I have many jobs
00:08:08.580 and currently the data science and
00:08:10.680 analytics read that transcending
00:08:12.139 TransUnion is one of the our biggest
00:08:15.360 credit beers International League
00:08:17.520 and be basically track the financial
00:08:20.280 transaction of people all across the
00:08:22.979 building
00:08:24.419 at the same time I'm working part-time
00:08:26.220 here at the LSU I've been teaching for
00:08:28.740 the past four years I've been teaching
00:08:30.360 data science
00:08:32.399 um I'm a faculty member of the computer
00:08:33.958 science department sorry it's software
00:08:35.880 technology and computer College of
00:08:37.919 computers
00:08:39.059 am I inclusion computer science and data
00:08:41.219 science and AI courses
00:08:44.099 I used to work as a data engineer data
00:08:46.080 scientist and a Philippines
00:08:48.899 and I used to be an AI
00:08:50.940 and machine learning consultant at the
00:08:53.580 Development Bank
00:08:56.640 I took my msf
00:08:58.620 Asian Institute of Management and I was
00:09:01.140 a software engineer I've been doing
00:09:03.000 mobile applications like previously
00:09:08.220 yes the console coming at DLC
00:09:11.399 yeah we also offer many courses here at
00:09:14.700 tlsu like foundations data science data
00:09:17.399 python database engineering I just
00:09:19.680 thought that a while ago that's the
00:09:21.360 class that I had this morning
00:09:23.220 um I'm also teaching minor data science
00:09:24.839 some of my students are from that
00:09:27.420 um course here in the LSU so we teach
00:09:29.820 data science
00:09:31.800 um database data mining machine learning
00:09:33.300 and we have this is now longer coming
00:09:35.640 it's official we have an msnbs
00:09:39.019 so I have many other engagements yeah
00:09:41.519 I'm the Ambassador for CN Foundation it
00:09:43.980 was awarded the top data scientists in
00:09:45.600 the CN last year an early data scientist
00:09:48.300 for one of the national AI initiatives
00:09:51.720 here in the country here in the
00:09:52.800 Philippines and I'm a mentoring
00:09:54.480 consultant for many institutions
00:09:57.839 so for the enablement session
00:10:00.779 um
00:10:01.500 why should you be interested in this
00:10:03.420 well for one it is free and then you get
00:10:06.480 access to sap Cloud up until the end of
00:10:08.640 the year you get upskilled and data
00:10:10.980 science and analytics even when a total
00:10:12.959 price of 17K USD and you go to Jakarta
00:10:15.899 for the regional finals this is not
00:10:18.000 April 28th this is
00:10:20.040 um May no it was extended
00:10:24.779 yeah so what is
00:10:27.000 um CN foundation so a CM leaders
00:10:29.399 recognize that they remain inadequate
00:10:31.920 shared prosperity and awareness and
00:10:33.660 contact number of people with a CM was
00:10:35.519 because of this concern that the CM
00:10:37.019 leaders established the scene Foundation
00:10:39.120 during the CN 30th Anniversary
00:10:41.000 commemorative Summit in Kuala Lumpur
00:10:43.080 Malaysia on December 15 1997 the
00:10:45.660 division of this institution is to build
00:10:48.420 a cohesive and prosperous in community
00:10:50.160 the mission is to commit to promote the
00:10:52.140 CN awareness through people-to-people
00:10:53.760 interaction and collaboration with the
00:10:55.399 stakeholders to build them to build a
00:10:57.660 caring cohesive Equitable and peaceful
00:10:59.820 Asian community
00:11:01.760 so here's the timeline for the CM data
00:11:05.339 science explorers
00:11:06.660 so again the call for applications was
00:11:09.120 extended
00:11:10.260 um it's uh dismayed and the enablement
00:11:13.440 sessions up until the end of
00:11:15.720 um this month May
00:11:17.820 in the storyboard submission also make
00:11:20.279 so storyboard shortlisting it's June so
00:11:24.899 um they will check who will qualify for
00:11:27.480 the national finals yeah they'll
00:11:29.579 announce it may July and then
00:11:32.640 um you get to go to the regional finals
00:11:34.980 a few International finals so division
00:11:37.620 final sales on is in October
00:11:44.519 the overview of the enablement sessions
00:11:46.500 so the objective of that is to really
00:11:48.720 introduce you to use app analytics cloud
00:11:50.480 and learn um the foundations of
00:11:52.980 analytics also to promote the CN data
00:11:55.800 science of course competition you'll be
00:11:57.720 well you may use other tools but it
00:12:00.180 assigning suggested that you use Google
00:12:01.920 Chrome and Incognito to access Sac so
00:12:05.579 that it works properly
00:12:07.320 I'll be giving a shared account for the
00:12:09.839 enabling session so you get to play
00:12:11.459 around with the cloud tool
00:12:13.980 and the access by that is up until the
00:12:16.019 end of the year to keep the Credence the
00:12:18.240 credentials that I'll be giving
00:12:20.160 can um yeah so interested to be as a c
00:12:23.339 account straight up
00:12:25.680 normally it costs 21 USD per month
00:12:32.940 so what is the data science explorers
00:12:35.519 program all about creative so it's a
00:12:37.620 regional data analytics competition
00:12:39.480 joint organized by the Sea foundation in
00:12:42.120 sap across all Tennessean member states
00:12:44.820 and what you have to do is to develop
00:12:46.800 data-driven storyboards to address the
00:12:49.560 six social economic issues in sorry the
00:12:51.899 to address the social economic issues
00:12:53.579 nscn across in the six unspgs and those
00:12:57.480 sdgs are the following so first is scv6
00:13:00.779 which is clean water and sanitation stg7
00:13:03.480 affordable and clean energy sdg8 these
00:13:06.839 Network and economic growth scg-11
00:13:09.240 sustainable cities and communities
00:13:10.880 xcg-12 responsible consumption and
00:13:12.959 production and finally
00:13:14.639 um sdg-13 climate action
00:13:16.740 again there's two levels so there's the
00:13:18.540 national level in the original level
00:13:21.540 so you get to go to Japan for the reason
00:13:23.399 number one where the eligible
00:13:24.959 participants yeah seeing people CN youth
00:13:28.260 page 15 to 30 taking full-time education
00:13:30.899 could be masses to be undergrad so I
00:13:34.139 seriously full-time under 15 to 30
00:13:36.600 you're good to go for the competition
00:13:44.399 and um it supports the following sem
00:13:46.620 priorities such as a CN word plan on
00:13:49.320 youth the CN work plan on education as
00:13:51.660 in Social cultural Community you see an
00:13:53.940 economic community and CN digital master
00:13:56.100 plan
00:14:00.660 um so this has been ongoing for the past
00:14:02.760 few years now and impact are as follows
00:14:05.220 so um 91 develop additional skills now
00:14:08.040 thought in the classroom 90 increase
00:14:10.200 their awareness about a CNN lasting
00:14:12.600 genes which send our promoters Warrior
00:14:14.660 57.25 which indicates an excellent
00:14:16.920 experience for participants and finally
00:14:19.260 positive impact sport on Career so it's
00:14:22.320 7.63 out of 10 which means a high
00:14:24.420 positive impact
00:14:28.920 if you want to know more details you can
00:14:30.660 go to the cnbse webpage I've also pasted
00:14:33.300 this link on the chat
00:14:34.860 so like how you can join the competition
00:14:36.779 the children create the storyboard the
00:14:38.639 finance and whatnot
00:14:40.139 any questions
00:14:47.579 good
00:14:49.560 okay good so far
00:14:54.000 yeah it could also follow us on social
00:14:55.800 media so we have Facebook page Instagram
00:14:58.019 page or the website
00:15:07.440 great
00:15:11.279 yeah
00:15:12.660 um I should proceed to do the analytics
00:15:15.660 fundamentals
00:15:17.339 hold on I'll share another side deck
00:16:03.480 hold on sharing it now
00:16:09.240 foreign
00:16:30.680 this is very high level
00:16:33.300 so analytics what is it so
00:16:36.480 um you could simplify it in
00:16:38.699 um using this following statement so
00:16:40.620 it's leveraging data to generate
00:16:42.120 actionable Insight think of like one
00:16:44.459 Lego pieces your singular data point and
00:16:47.519 if you combine them you can now create a
00:16:49.680 story how you can sort it you can
00:16:52.380 organize it and by doing all those
00:16:54.779 things you could now tell a story
00:16:57.079 your stakeholders
00:16:59.880 what are the different use cases of
00:17:02.040 analytics
00:17:03.660 um there's business intelligence I mean
00:17:05.699 if it's like organizing data to capture
00:17:07.319 Trends and size information go listen to
00:17:09.959 build it reports think of your typical
00:17:12.179 dashboards
00:17:13.980 um basically you just visualize
00:17:15.540 something and it could now help your
00:17:19.079 um virus stakeholders into deciding on
00:17:21.359 something
00:17:23.459 predictive you could use analytics to do
00:17:26.459 forecasting and identify anomalies for
00:17:29.280 planning you could perform much of
00:17:31.500 simulations the Min Maps were the best
00:17:33.960 case outcome so these are just some of
00:17:36.539 the unrealistic spaces there are more
00:17:38.700 there are more sophisticated ones like
00:17:42.059 um yeah I'm pretty sure you've played
00:17:43.860 with chat GBP and other modern aisles
00:17:46.860 store those are some these are just the
00:17:49.080 basic ones
00:17:51.600 so question do you know this animal
00:17:54.539 attacks in your day-to-day life
00:17:58.200 how about um I'll try to call people how
00:18:00.960 about you Jamie
00:18:04.020 do you know this analytics in your
00:18:05.580 day-to-day life
00:18:09.299 Cameron Alexis
00:18:17.220 so here or maybe or maybe let's call
00:18:19.140 another person instead
00:18:21.600 um Christian
00:18:24.720 moneda
00:18:32.640 do you know this analytics in your
00:18:34.140 day-to-day life
00:18:38.700 hello
00:18:41.820 I asked
00:18:47.400 okay yeah maybe they're having issues
00:18:49.919 anyway yeah um in my case I I noticed it
00:18:52.980 in my day-to-day life it's everywhere
00:18:55.980 um if you use Google there's analytics
00:18:57.960 in it
00:18:59.580 um it knows your previous search history
00:19:02.640 so it will there come in something that
00:19:05.580 um is more appropriate to you if you've
00:19:08.160 been if you've been a programmer so you
00:19:10.679 are searching lots of programming terms
00:19:13.440 so few type of term that is that could
00:19:16.140 have many interpretations but your
00:19:18.780 program is also just something that is
00:19:20.460 related to them something like that
00:19:27.500 the analytics is everywhere
00:19:30.900 um you can see lots of applications here
00:19:33.419 and use them for different things so we
00:19:37.260 have ways
00:19:39.059 um if you want to know where to drive
00:19:40.820 you have
00:19:42.840 fender
00:19:44.580 um this is for put to date
00:19:47.400 um for what to listen you have Spotify
00:19:49.220 we have Netflix for what to watch and
00:19:52.679 how to do things you have YouTube so you
00:19:54.600 have all these applications for your
00:19:56.280 various things
00:19:58.080 experiences by similar individuals allow
00:19:59.880 us to discover similar interests and
00:20:01.200 lifestyles
00:20:04.860 hello can you still hear me am I Audible
00:20:09.660 why not let me check
00:20:12.360 hello
00:20:15.000 okay
00:20:21.299 yeah and it is different for everyone
00:20:24.660 so that's customized
00:20:27.419 um like Netflix your feed is customized
00:20:31.380 depending on your interests in my case I
00:20:34.440 would be seeing lots of Dark shows or
00:20:37.200 anime skills that's my preference
00:20:40.919 it's different for everyone
00:20:43.559 and it changes every day like for
00:20:46.260 example Waze
00:20:48.179 um it depends on the current traffic
00:20:49.799 situation it will suggest different
00:20:51.419 routes right if there is
00:20:54.600 um if a user reports that there's an
00:20:56.820 incident in this particular road then um
00:20:59.880 you'll be seeing another recommended
00:21:01.679 throughout instead
00:21:06.000 yeah what a screenshot it differs based
00:21:09.539 on the application that you use
00:21:11.700 um if you use
00:21:13.260 um waste what is being trapped what do
00:21:15.419 you think
00:21:17.760 how about you Gabriel what do you think
00:21:19.320 is being trapped if if you use ways
00:21:22.200 Gabriel uh I most like the your location
00:21:25.500 location that is correct yes the
00:21:28.080 location and also
00:21:30.960 um the crowdsource data like if this
00:21:33.539 person reports there's an incident here
00:21:35.340 right it's also being used that we're
00:21:36.840 just being trapped what if you use um
00:21:39.059 Tinder what is being trapped
00:21:41.940 Karen what do you think is being trapped
00:21:43.559 if you use um Tinder
00:21:49.919 is Karen here
00:21:56.100 how about you
00:22:09.780 anyway
00:22:10.740 um yeah um it uses gender this is gender
00:22:15.059 it uses many other features type uh
00:22:17.159 location yes your preferences so that it
00:22:20.580 could match you with
00:22:22.740 um Partridge that is
00:22:25.740 um recently I guess
00:22:28.320 so yeah it depends on the application
00:22:30.000 that you're using
00:22:32.100 marketed ads yeah same concept
00:22:35.220 um it depends on your preference as this
00:22:37.740 personalized
00:22:42.179 Innovations through analytics
00:22:45.000 um so analytics Consciousness help
00:22:47.220 promote Habits by using like uh smart
00:22:49.679 variables so in my case I do use that I
00:22:53.100 keep on using my smart watch to track
00:22:55.500 many things about me like my heart rate
00:22:57.780 by steps my oxygen level and I adjust my
00:23:03.960 um personal fitness goals based on what
00:23:06.539 I'm seeing on the application so I
00:23:09.000 typically have like um minimum steps of
00:23:12.419 like 20 that's that's my minimum ideally
00:23:15.120 to anything so I'm
00:23:17.159 I'm in the fitness so I do a lot of
00:23:19.440 those things for my sleep I I'm happy if
00:23:22.020 I already have like six hours of sleep
00:23:23.880 immediately ideally
00:23:29.400 okay analytics role in curbing code with
00:23:31.860 19. so it is very essential
00:23:35.039 um during the pandemic because uh with
00:23:37.440 analytics we are now able to inform
00:23:39.720 decisions on what we're gonna do with
00:23:42.480 regards to the policy uh for example um
00:23:45.539 we make use of the epidemiological
00:23:48.480 models the standard ones like sir modern
00:23:50.880 that's the typical model used for
00:23:53.460 projecting
00:23:54.960 um these kinds of things like from
00:23:56.400 pandemic so
00:23:58.320 I'm given the projections we will now
00:24:00.720 tell the various policy makers the
00:24:03.419 government officials that take
00:24:05.460 um if uh after the next few days or
00:24:07.980 months this will be the positivity rate
00:24:10.380 this will be the number of questions for
00:24:11.820 this particular location so you might
00:24:13.559 have to
00:24:15.240 um impose a more 300 tool and um on
00:24:19.140 lockdown something like that so it is
00:24:21.179 very important in preparing covid-19 and
00:24:23.880 um even as simple as just visualizing
00:24:25.860 things you can already have an idea on
00:24:27.600 which um applications are performing bad
00:24:30.120 very good and get adjust your decision
00:24:33.480 making based on what you're seeing
00:24:37.980 Sports yeah basketball is a very good
00:24:41.760 data set because if you go to the
00:24:44.100 basketball website it has so many data
00:24:47.400 it's it's variation data and it's one of
00:24:50.460 the
00:24:51.659 um well-tracked Sports so you could
00:24:54.120 predict so many things already but if
00:24:55.860 you ask their data if you're um new to
00:24:58.620 data science you could go to
00:25:01.140 um the basketball website and then just
00:25:02.940 download the data and play around with
00:25:04.260 it
00:25:07.500 Sports yeah Esports South also supports
00:25:10.679 that so this is dota Dota 2 specifically
00:25:13.860 so um we could already track many things
00:25:16.679 with that and predict
00:25:18.179 the win rate based on many other factors
00:25:23.280 so it's a summary analytics is
00:25:26.159 leveraging data for actionable insight
00:25:28.159 analytics is all around us and shapes
00:25:30.720 our daily lives and analytics is the
00:25:33.360 fuel for Innovation and progress
00:25:36.120 any questions
00:25:44.039 no
00:25:47.159 so um we will be using sub analytics
00:25:50.279 Cloud to
00:25:52.440 perform data analysis
00:25:56.279 basically we will be doing
00:25:59.279 um a basic ETL if you've heard of that
00:26:01.380 before it's extract transform node
00:26:04.020 so
00:26:05.159 who will collect the data we will do
00:26:07.559 some cleaning some pre-processing
00:26:09.659 and then do um some machine learning
00:26:12.659 although it is abstracted to you guys
00:26:15.840 um it does a projection on its own with
00:26:17.760 the tool you don't um get to really do
00:26:21.299 it on your own so yeah
00:26:23.100 um it's already abstract with you and
00:26:24.659 then finding some dashboards some
00:26:26.100 visualization on those things
00:26:30.480 again um use incognito
00:26:33.299 I'll give the credentials
00:26:35.700 any questions
00:26:37.200 yeah if you want to know more about
00:26:38.700 visualization to access these things
00:26:42.779 informations to beautiful.net.sap.com
00:26:52.620 still following
00:27:01.380 okay
00:27:08.460 Michelle

00:27:48.900 you can try to access that
00:27:53.460 I believe you've also downloaded the
00:27:55.320 data set
00:28:37.980 uh you can use this for the competition
00:28:41.039 but um if you're going to participate in
00:28:42.900 the competition

00:32:07.260 this is the path again my first public
00:32:09.840 yeah they are the Philippines dinosaur
00:32:11.399 University
00:32:12.659 then let's create
00:32:14.640 um I will aggravate for you I will
00:32:16.620 create a new folder for our recession

00:32:25.320 and you will be saving your files here
00:32:32.039 so go inside and I suggest that you add
00:32:34.679 your name so you know that it is
00:32:36.500 basically we are cloning
00:32:40.080 on this story boy
00:32:42.120 should put it here
00:32:45.840 okay
00:32:52.140 should clone that
00:32:59.039 so this is the path
00:33:01.860 before you get
00:33:04.919 hold on it's loading
00:33:07.080 I suggest that you have two tabs one is
00:33:09.720 for the storyboard
00:33:11.279 the one that you just copied earlier

00:33:37.019 save your file here Philippines uh the
00:33:39.720 Southern University and then the
00:33:41.700 day-to-day
00:33:46.260 you save it there
00:33:48.720 okay seeing one
00:33:50.940 storyboard here
00:33:53.159 aside from mine so please save it here
00:33:56.100 please save it here
00:33:58.860 should be seeing your copies here
00:34:21.418 please save it here I'm only seeing two
00:34:27.060 where are the others
00:34:34.379 only three
00:34:36.418 we have 27 participants by the others
00:34:49.320 save us and then save it here look at

00:35:37.859 again you save it like this edit
00:35:41.160 save as
00:35:43.200 go to that folder
00:35:45.359 that I've
00:35:47.460 shown here
00:35:50.760 files my files public

00:35:56.040 s in the my files files my files public
00:35:58.980 save your file here
00:36:00.660 Philippines Del Sol University
00:36:06.780 four stars
00:36:15.000 again this path
00:36:19.320 this path
00:36:29.460 about the others
00:36:31.260 what issues are you having I'm only
00:36:34.140 seeing
00:36:36.660 five folder five files here
00:36:47.940 hello
00:36:49.980 let me know so I can assist you
00:37:16.680 okay
00:37:18.599 um I see that some of you are using
00:37:20.579 their mobile phones today so they can't
00:37:22.320 do this uh but can you please um do this
00:37:25.740 later and then answer the survey so you
00:37:28.500 will get your certificates all right
00:37:31.140 is that understood
00:37:35.640 okay so I believe we can proceed now
00:37:39.720 maybe the others can't do it right now
00:37:41.760 but they'll watch the recording I will
00:37:43.740 send the recording it share this to
00:37:46.020 others as well and so as you do the
00:37:48.420 survey I will give you certificates okay
00:37:53.880 understood
00:37:56.760 it but it's her you can do this whenever
00:38:00.480 you're free
00:38:01.920 so I'm seeing quite a few
00:38:04.200 you can proceed now so let's go back to
00:38:07.320 the story boy so this is actually your
00:38:09.780 cheat sheet everything that we'll be
00:38:12.060 doing is here
00:38:13.680 everything is here
00:38:15.839 so the goal is to do the following
00:38:18.480 this is our agenda to do data modeling
00:38:20.820 smart Discovery designer mode data
00:38:22.560 explore mode and styling so for deeper
00:38:25.020 model that you learn the basics of
00:38:26.160 uploading data sets and into
00:38:27.480 transformation then smart Discovery we
00:38:30.119 welcome inside generation there's some
00:38:33.000 um ml behind the scenes here for
00:38:35.280 designer mode of the grass support
00:38:37.079 function now we suffocate more graphs
00:38:38.640 and then um data export mode we can
00:38:41.099 discover insights from our data set
00:38:43.200 just another way of doing designer mode
00:38:45.180 actually and then styling yeah you just
00:38:48.300 um modify your graphs so that's what we
00:38:51.000 will be doing in the next few minutes
00:38:53.940 we should be done before three yeah
00:38:57.060 should be relatively quick
00:39:00.660 okay
00:39:02.579 so now we proceed to data modeling so
00:39:04.740 again this is your cheat sheet your file
00:39:07.920 that you just saved that's searching too
00:39:10.320 if you're lost you can follow
00:39:13.020 so we can ask questions
00:39:16.440 so the first thing that we'll have to do
00:39:18.119 is go to modulator
00:39:20.820 so where's the modeling click this one
00:39:23.640 and you should see the modular here
00:39:28.020 and then
00:39:30.300 from a CSV or Excel file now
00:39:33.540 the CSV file should be the one that I
00:39:35.820 have just given you through email please
00:39:37.980 upload that
00:39:46.440 have you uploaded it
00:39:48.000 yeah I will wait I should be seeing it
00:39:49.740 here if you're able to upload
00:39:53.940 yeah someone just uploaded it so we'll
00:39:56.280 just upload it
00:39:58.920 you can see it
00:40:01.680 so please upload that
00:40:05.220 so we will be using that data set that's
00:40:07.500 actually
00:40:09.060 um the Kobe data set from Google
00:40:12.839 and we will be doing some analysis on
00:40:15.119 that data
00:40:20.099 okay we support that
00:40:24.180 yeah I'm seeing that some people are
00:40:25.500 uploading that's good that's good
00:40:28.920 that's good
00:40:30.540 so choose one
00:40:35.040 when you have uploaded it
00:40:39.960 CSV CSE the csv1
00:40:44.280 upload CSV
00:40:54.359 so once you're done with that you should
00:40:56.160 be seeing this View
00:40:59.280 okay
00:41:01.260 you will see that there is an issue with
00:41:04.079 our data set
00:41:05.640 you can't create the model yet you will
00:41:08.160 see a red highlight here
00:41:11.460 see and if you look at the data quality
00:41:14.040 it's not 100
00:41:15.859 why is that the case what is wrong
00:41:18.960 what do you think is wrong
00:41:24.359 any guesses
00:41:26.040 what is wrong with the date
00:41:28.980 column the data type yes what is wrong
00:41:31.140 with the two values here
00:41:33.359 the formatting that is correct
00:41:35.640 so we have to fix that that's one good
00:41:37.980 thing with this platform it
00:41:39.900 automatically detected that this is
00:41:41.820 supposed to be
00:41:43.200 a date data and a few rows here are not
00:41:48.119 following the typical date time format
00:41:50.579 right
00:41:51.540 so we have to change this
00:41:53.640 how
00:41:55.740 you could click that click that and then
00:41:57.960 click that and then click this
00:42:00.540 yeah replace firm 24 2020 with this one
00:42:03.720 although you still know that this is not
00:42:05.460 correct right
00:42:06.720 so you just modify it manually so Feb 24
00:42:11.280 um 2020 is supposed to be this

00:42:36.900 let's let's do it again maybe there's
00:42:38.579 just a bug
00:42:43.680 now let's save it again
00:42:54.599 I'll just refresh mine I think um
00:42:57.599 it's having some issues
00:43:00.720 but uh what I've done earlier I should

00:43:05.579 let me just refresh it
00:43:07.619 boom ah it's corrupted that is why the
00:43:11.520 file is gone um yeah I'll just redo it
00:43:13.980 again
00:43:18.119 the fellow scroll up with my end
00:43:21.720 let me just choose whatever
00:43:33.060 um hold on let's
00:43:36.420 might be because there are many users
00:43:38.339 that's why it's lagging hold on let me
00:43:41.280 just wait
00:43:43.740 we're sharing this account
00:43:48.119 so again do that through that change it
00:43:51.839 oh sorry change that one
00:43:54.359 zero zero two then before
00:43:58.079 should work now

00:44:06.119 is the only one that pass in there right
00:44:07.319 now
00:44:08.280 um we have to edit it again same stuff
00:44:10.500 same stuff same stuff
00:44:13.980 but it should be 25.
00:44:20.640 still following
00:44:30.060 type yes if you're still following
00:44:32.579 let me actually just click create model
00:44:35.040 because you have now cleaned your data
00:44:40.319 still following type yes
00:44:49.140 hello
00:44:51.359 should take some time yeah should take
00:44:53.280 some time
00:44:55.440 you're creating the model now it's
00:44:57.180 running some general behind the scenes
00:45:00.900 with that data set
00:45:11.460 yeah
00:45:13.940 yeah create save it
00:45:17.280 actually in the same folder just add
00:45:19.980 your name again yes a bit slow today
00:45:24.839 snow in the initial
00:45:27.300 it wasn't like this previously
00:45:34.740 we wait
00:45:41.839 yeah it's just no
00:45:53.339 but yeah same back same back
00:45:56.700 same same fat
00:46:04.740 same path
00:46:16.680 save it there
00:46:22.740 and then we just we just wait
00:46:45.599 okay you're done right look at what
00:46:48.119 happened I think I got something
00:46:51.720 yeah it's a bit buggy right now
00:46:54.900 because there's so many people
00:46:57.599 well even before it wasn't like this
00:46:59.400 even though I had many people
00:47:07.140 yes Gabriel yes
00:47:09.660 hello sir uh could you show us again how
00:47:12.180 we can change the value sorry I was a
00:47:14.520 bit uh lagging earlier
00:47:16.680 hold on let me try to uh let's try yeah
00:47:20.520 because I was trying to click on it like
00:47:24.060 a typical Excel file but I can't edit
00:47:26.520 the number right right thank you so much
00:47:33.440 it's much slower than usual
00:47:40.380 yeah don't worry about that yeah you
00:47:42.720 will be seeing that there's some other
00:47:44.819 people don't worry about that don't
00:47:46.740 worry about that
00:47:48.780 yeah it's just slow
00:47:51.960 today
00:47:53.880 I'll show it in a bit be well hold on
00:47:56.099 hold on uh let me just
00:47:58.380 wait for this
00:48:01.079 sure sure thank you always
00:48:04.319 so bad
00:48:08.880 let me try if there are other founder I
00:48:11.339 think we can use the same file because
00:48:12.960 it's the same for everyone
00:48:14.640 so yeah we don't
00:48:16.859 wait for this
00:48:19.440 flag problem
00:48:25.680 let me see that other people were able
00:48:27.660 to save
00:48:28.680 only you Brian I will also save
00:48:32.339 and I hope you can use my
00:48:35.280 later
00:48:36.839 just use mine
00:48:40.560 oh that was successful
00:48:43.260 that's nice
00:48:48.540 hold on
00:48:52.020 okay so the question that you had
00:48:54.060 earlier it was
00:48:55.920 um
00:48:56.520 how to edit that okay let me go back
00:48:59.760 modular
00:49:02.819 so
00:49:04.200 um
00:49:05.700 sample
00:49:08.460 this is how you edit
00:49:10.500 yes uh everyone will get a recording of
00:49:13.680 this later everyone
00:49:22.380 so here click that
00:49:25.760 there should be
00:49:28.319 this pop-up right here
00:49:30.839 click that smart transformations
00:49:34.319 click that
00:49:36.000 click that
00:49:37.800 and then you modify this one because it
00:49:40.500 is still not correct right
00:49:43.380 oh hold on that's
00:49:45.200 performing some calculations
00:49:50.280 this slow right
00:49:52.500 so it should be 2020 0224 instead
00:49:57.540 uh it is blocking in the view I can
00:50:00.839 click it
00:50:02.460 we wait we wait
00:50:05.160 we will
00:50:17.460 modify this one just make it 0.24
00:50:30.000 yeah that's what you do
00:50:32.520 same video thank you so much I was able
00:50:35.700 to do it
00:50:36.619 okay okay great
00:50:41.280 that's it for if you upload actually
00:50:46.500 um
00:50:54.900 what's next
00:50:59.220 I will discard because I was able to do
00:51:01.079 it again this is your cheat sheet so get
00:51:03.599 lost look at this so we were able to do
00:51:06.240 this we were able to upload we're able
00:51:08.160 to clean and modify that on wrong row
00:51:11.700 and then what we will do next is to go
00:51:15.180 here
00:51:17.400 so we'll get two models for sure
00:51:20.220 so remember we have saved something
00:51:22.260 earlier right
00:51:27.780 should my file should be here but you
00:51:30.240 just go to where you saved it we
00:51:32.700 actually just asked this mine I'm okay
00:51:34.380 with that
00:51:35.640 so let's go to that
00:51:37.980 um file again
00:51:43.980 where is Philippines
00:51:46.859 uh
00:51:53.220 so
00:51:55.680 where is well
00:51:57.720 but why is mine missing it was is able
00:52:01.260 to generate that earlier
00:52:05.640 it is now gone my
00:52:07.920 my fire is gone
00:52:11.579 I will just access my previous ones as
00:52:13.740 the same thing
00:52:15.780 um I was able to do that before so
00:52:19.980 I will use my previous one
00:52:29.160 so it's the same thing oh you just click
00:52:31.319 that you can click this actually I'm
00:52:33.660 okay with that
00:52:38.940 then go to model structure make sure
00:52:42.540 that it is model structured okay
00:52:45.059 you really have a question
00:52:49.140 no I'm sorry I wasn't able to put it
00:52:51.059 down no reasons so quick model structure
00:52:56.520 click account
00:53:00.059 and then if you want a better View
00:53:03.720 um
00:53:06.900 maybe yeah click this
00:53:12.000 display mode to grid
00:53:14.339 so there's numbers
00:53:16.920 we will modify the positive rate
00:53:20.160 positive region
00:53:22.500 so context by default
00:53:25.559 um if you don't do anything
00:53:27.780 uh what sap would do is just add
00:53:31.680 everything so it's the song
00:53:33.900 but for a positive rate it should be the
00:53:36.300 average
00:53:37.920 um for each location and date
00:53:39.300 combination so you will have to modify
00:53:42.000 that you'll have to make it average
00:53:43.619 because by default it is empty you will
00:53:45.660 have to make it average
00:53:46.980 here exception aggregation average
00:53:51.300 and then the other
00:53:53.940 exception aggregation here
00:53:56.160 location
00:53:57.960 and the
00:54:00.420 you do that
00:54:04.380 and then you save it you save it
00:54:10.680 and now you're good to go
00:54:16.079 still following type yes
00:54:21.960 you just save it just save it
00:54:28.440 so that's how you upload and
00:54:31.920 um pre-process your data set
00:54:38.099 so again
00:54:39.420 um
00:54:40.040 it's I went out
00:54:43.680 um basically Waits
00:54:47.040 you go
00:54:48.420 to that folder again
00:54:52.980 um where you
00:54:54.120 [Music]
00:54:54.540 um
00:54:56.000 go to that folder where you
00:54:59.460 received your
00:55:01.500 file
00:55:14.099 you should be seeing your files here
00:55:15.780 again there was an issue for my file so
00:55:18.960 I'm just gonna reuse my old one click
00:55:21.780 that click that
00:55:24.000 your final not the storyboard but this
00:55:27.000 one with this logo okay this icon we
00:55:30.839 stab
00:55:33.359 just gonna use my
00:55:35.339 old one
00:55:40.980 it's a bit slow
00:55:49.680 again if you think you're lost and it's
00:55:52.859 just hard for you to follow
00:55:54.300 um it's all here
00:55:58.200 what I've done is also here actually so
00:56:00.960 you can always refer to this cheat sheet
00:56:02.880 always
00:56:04.260 okay so anyway I've clicked that and you
00:56:07.440 can see this view now
00:56:10.260 just click model structure make sure
00:56:12.420 that this model structure in your
00:56:13.920 workspace make sure and then click
00:56:16.200 account click account
00:56:19.380 see you should be seeing the same thing
00:56:21.119 here
00:56:23.400 see model structure
00:56:26.520 want to search for account and then
00:56:28.319 positive rate
00:56:29.880 and then should be the average
00:56:33.180 and location the same thing same thing
00:56:38.579 positive rate
00:56:41.220 average location date same thing
00:56:44.819 okay
00:56:46.319 is everyone able to follow
00:56:49.740 type yes
00:56:57.960 type yes
00:56:59.160 everyone
00:57:02.819 hello
00:57:10.020 yes Gabriel
00:57:12.119 hello sir uh when I tried to change the
00:57:15.420 data for exception aggregation it turned
00:57:18.839 red it's okay it says that okay it's
00:57:21.300 okay yeah all right if you modify the
00:57:23.700 location it will now be okay so it
00:57:26.339 should be the combination vibration
00:57:27.839 location that's it
00:57:29.579 got it thank you
00:57:35.460 hello everyone we're able to follow
00:57:40.140 how about the others and when we seeing
00:57:43.020 a few
00:57:47.819 hello
00:57:49.500 okay
00:57:52.619 and you save it yeah just save it that's
00:57:55.079 it that's it
00:57:57.119 save it save it
00:58:00.480 if you go back that means we are done
00:58:03.480 with data modeling this first one here
00:58:06.960 we go to smart discovery
00:58:17.400 let me just
00:58:19.800 refresh it
00:58:21.720 again
00:58:35.760 smart discard we we're now here
00:58:40.380 we'll do stories
00:58:43.559 and then you use that file that we just
00:58:46.020 saved
00:58:47.819 okay let's do that
00:58:58.260 make sure that you don't type
00:59:00.359 application that you select that
00:59:02.760 please select the location there should
00:59:04.619 be like a drop down we don't manually
00:59:06.660 type it
00:59:16.500 let me know if it works
00:59:22.799 from here from a smart discovery
00:59:26.520 classic design experience create
00:59:30.839 again stories
00:59:32.700 classic
00:59:34.740 and then you access that file that you
00:59:37.500 just saved same thing again
00:59:40.260 same thing
00:59:56.880 like this one I saved it right
01:00:01.380 should be seeing something after a
01:00:04.260 minute or two it will take some time
01:00:08.359 But first you have to select the target
01:00:13.020 you can always check again the cheat
01:00:16.020 sheet if you forget
01:00:18.319 it's all here so
01:00:21.660 um what is the topic should be the
01:00:22.980 positive rate and the delegation that's
01:00:25.740 it so we do that here
01:00:28.859 so positive rate
01:00:33.660 and then location
01:00:35.880 that's it
01:00:37.920 and the neuron and then you will
01:00:44.700 see
01:00:54.599 is everyone seeing the same thing is it
01:00:56.700 loading on your end
01:00:58.740 should be loading
01:01:04.920 hello
01:01:14.339 should be loaded so while you wait you
01:01:16.260 can check the next parts
01:01:20.819 it's really just exploring the
01:01:23.480 automatic forecasting and graph
01:01:26.460 capabilities of self that's really it
01:01:31.040 will be addressed in a bit
01:01:34.319 we're almost done I would say I'm
01:01:37.440 probably in the next few minutes yeah
01:01:42.480 the rest are very easy to do
01:01:48.599 while we're waiting yeah while we're
01:01:50.520 waving so again you can always refer to
01:01:52.500 this don't forget don't forget
01:02:04.140 are you still able to follow type yes
01:02:27.180 yeah should be loading
01:02:30.359 yeah basically I'm just gonna show you
01:02:33.540 um the functionalities of this tool so
01:02:37.020 it automatically Ransom ml behind the
01:02:40.500 scenes and some um descriptive stats and
01:02:43.440 forecasting and whatnot so you can see
01:02:45.480 the total positive rate for location
01:02:47.160 0.09
01:02:49.680 um it shows you the top positive rates
01:02:52.319 by location so the top ones would be
01:02:54.780 Mexico and Oman so yeah I just chose one
01:02:57.839 of those so a woman has the highest
01:02:59.880 possibility rate together with Mexico
01:03:01.799 from the total so far for July
01:03:05.480 30.36 Clipper click view more
01:03:08.819 you have to click view more it will have
01:03:10.680 to zoom out because
01:03:12.839 just
01:03:13.859 it's too big
01:03:15.599 hold on hold on
01:03:18.299 again view more
01:03:23.579 it's
01:03:25.559 open and you
01:03:28.200 window
01:03:30.780 and you could modify
01:03:34.380 um the change rate so this is per day
01:03:36.839 you can see how it has changed
01:03:41.040 the past few days but you can make it
01:03:42.900 monthly or particularly to get the idea
01:03:46.140 so some high level stats it already
01:03:48.960 generated that for you
01:03:54.059 everything with respect to positive rate
01:03:55.980 because that's their target that we
01:03:58.319 chose okay and this is also the forecast
01:04:00.980 try to forecast
01:04:04.200 um the next positive rate values
01:04:08.040 by default that is 19 90 days 90 from
01:04:11.420 data points
01:04:15.500 yeah that's uh pretty much it
01:04:19.380 um you also have the key influencers tab
01:04:23.040 here
01:04:23.880 there is a key influencers to go there
01:04:30.839 it shows you the influence of the
01:04:33.000 different
01:04:34.680 um features with respect to positive
01:04:37.799 rate
01:04:40.319 so for example total debts per million
01:04:42.960 has a weak influence on power
01:04:46.319 um
01:04:47.339 positivity yeah
01:04:49.980 and it is correlated with these features
01:04:57.000 so uh now uh you get to have an idea
01:04:59.819 about what could potentially impact our
01:05:01.859 pasta rate if we're going to recommend
01:05:03.299 something to policy makers
01:05:06.420 so let's proceed to use simulation here
01:05:13.020 so we start with on 0.1 positive rate
01:05:16.319 right
01:05:17.640 now try to play around with the values
01:05:19.740 this is a simulation so try to play
01:05:22.140 around the device and your goal is to
01:05:23.819 make it zero
01:05:25.680 modify the parameters so for example
01:05:27.599 total that's per node what if I
01:05:30.900 um make it like this I make it 91 115
01:05:34.079 and then simulate it
01:05:36.599 so the positive rate is now 0.07 now you
01:05:40.559 play around with this let's resume it a
01:05:42.480 bit we'll have a break
01:05:44.220 um 10 minute break and then your goal is
01:05:46.020 to make it zero so feel free to play
01:05:49.260 around with values and then share share
01:05:52.799 it in the chat if you're able to make it
01:05:54.119 zero
01:05:56.160 share a screenshot that you're able to
01:05:58.260 make it zero and let me know what you
01:06:00.059 modified
01:06:02.460 and that's for smart Discovery and then
01:06:05.160 we will be doing the other ones in a bit
01:06:07.500 and it is quite fast
01:06:10.440 so we will be done in the next few
01:06:13.619 minutes so 10 minute break first okay
01:06:15.839 feel free to play around with the values
01:06:18.359 try to simulate it and make it zero
01:06:21.059 will you zoom in a bit but you can ask
01:06:22.619 questions I'll read them
01:06:30.480 this portion
01:10:02.040 because
01:14:52.020 okay I think
01:14:55.199 um some of you are able to do that thank
01:14:58.320 you
01:14:59.159 um that's nice you're able to make it
01:15:00.600 zero
01:15:05.159 so what's your thought process uh how
01:15:08.100 about you Josh Aaron what's your thought
01:15:10.020 about this how are you able to make it
01:15:11.400 zero what do you do
01:15:22.260 for um Gabriel
01:15:27.840 hello
01:15:33.300 hello so yeah I'll go first
01:15:36.120 um I'm not actually quite sure about my
01:15:38.400 ad my the way I work on it yesterday it
01:15:42.000 showed negative on the so I'm not sure
01:15:46.340 so it's okay zero that's okay oh okay
01:15:50.580 so honestly what I did was I just
01:15:52.739 randomly played around the data set so
01:15:55.920 I'm not quite sure how he's doing that
01:15:58.199 but the thing is
01:16:01.080 um
01:16:02.340 I still can't like somehow make sense of
01:16:05.159 all the data involved that's okay but
01:16:07.560 yeah
01:16:10.500 it's okay
01:16:14.460 so I'm seeing a chat here from Josh
01:16:16.260 Aaron so
01:16:17.820 um he played around the variables and
01:16:19.199 check which variables are more sensitive
01:16:21.420 yeah that's great um that's also what I
01:16:24.120 will be doing I will check the impact
01:16:26.699 that's interesting I will do
01:16:29.820 um how it impacts the score so look at
01:16:33.420 this this is your guide if it is
01:16:36.000 strongly negative then that means
01:16:38.940 if I increase that
01:16:40.920 it should decrease the score
01:16:43.080 Let's test it
01:16:46.860 it's a negative relationship
01:16:50.580 now we dropped okay good so far
01:16:53.699 let's look for the other ones are very
01:16:55.440 strong strongly negative if I increase
01:16:57.719 this it should also drop
01:17:00.000 right it should
01:17:02.520 0.05
01:17:04.260 what else can we change
01:17:06.420 positive so if I make this negative
01:17:10.320 or I mean I decrease it then that means
01:17:13.260 it should drop
01:17:15.659 C
01:17:16.739 what else can we change negative
01:17:19.140 relationship if I increase this it
01:17:21.480 should be
01:17:23.760 well let's try to
01:17:26.940 okay one more one more one more thing
01:17:29.640 okay weekly positive guess this one
01:17:33.300 um yeah negative we could also do this
01:17:35.940 one if we increase this should be
01:17:38.940 zero eventually
01:17:40.860 let's try to Max it
01:17:43.260 or it's still not enough
01:17:46.500 or maybe you also have to modify this
01:17:48.960 quickly positive Supply
01:17:52.380 um
01:17:53.159 increase this yeah
01:17:58.020 fine
01:18:00.000 okay that's too much
01:18:01.980 that's too much
01:18:03.480 there there you go
01:18:07.620 see
01:18:11.460 okay still following type yes please
01:18:18.960 how about the others
01:18:26.520 okay
01:18:27.540 okay
01:18:32.760 great great okay let's proceed to the
01:18:35.340 next part we are almost done we are
01:18:37.739 almost done so designer mode so again uh
01:18:40.980 what we did with the first part is to
01:18:42.800 extract the data um do some
01:18:45.179 pre-processing
01:18:46.679 and the next part is
01:18:48.600 um some Auto ml some automated
01:18:51.780 statistics graphs and that simulation
01:18:54.620 and then
01:18:56.340 [Music]
01:18:56.640 um
01:18:57.679 then the designer mode so we're just
01:19:01.560 going to visualize the data
01:19:07.500 that's what we're going to do here you
01:19:08.940 just follow this actually now we're
01:19:10.560 going to use the storyboard commonly so
01:19:13.560 what does it want us to do click on the
01:19:16.260 yellow chart to the right make sure that
01:19:18.420 if it's in edit mode first edit it's
01:19:20.940 like that one
01:19:22.440 and then click on the yellow chart to
01:19:24.540 the right make sure that they're in
01:19:25.560 designer mode so this is the designer
01:19:27.719 mode
01:19:29.219 this one you see you see click that
01:19:32.820 and then
01:19:34.739 what does it tell us you have to
01:19:38.460 click
01:19:40.020 the line graph that's correct over 19
01:19:42.600 plus data correct select line graph
01:19:45.360 total confirmed cases correct from two
01:19:48.300 different cases and then the date that's
01:19:51.120 correct
01:19:52.320 and then the level the hierarchy level
01:19:55.140 for it that's great
01:20:01.500 that is correct that is correct
01:20:03.900 so what else let me just check if we're
01:20:06.120 missing something the total concerned
01:20:08.280 cases indeed that's correct
01:20:13.440 okay and that's it
01:20:16.440 we just I'm just gonna
01:20:21.120 modify a few things here
01:20:25.739 earliest latest
01:20:28.500 because they think yeah it was modified
01:20:34.020 so what do you think is the data type
01:20:37.140 that had the highest cases should be the
01:20:39.600 last rate because it's the most decent
01:20:41.880 thing
01:20:43.080 and it's cumulative so you're only
01:20:45.179 supposed to have more
01:20:47.219 um cases as time goes by
01:20:50.940 remove this top five all Dimensions
01:20:52.860 should be for everything this is the
01:20:54.840 whole graph
01:20:56.219 so when the pandemic started up until
01:20:58.860 the last date for this data set which is
01:21:02.480 2023 q1 we've had a total of 621
01:21:07.860 million cases
01:21:13.320 what else
01:21:15.060 create another chart we modify this
01:21:18.360 is about five rupees with the highest
01:21:20.159 cases so we follow this again designer
01:21:23.100 mode again this one we make these uh
01:21:26.100 what
01:21:27.600 um bar
01:21:29.400 we use foreign
01:21:36.420 measure total confirmed case and still
01:21:38.280 correct
01:21:39.120 country region
01:21:41.219 that's still great
01:21:43.500 good and then we click this one
01:21:45.960 click on the chart and click on the
01:21:48.239 Ellipsis here
01:21:49.560 and then rank
01:21:51.300 country region
01:21:53.040 top five
01:21:55.620 and that's it
01:22:01.320 so what's the
01:22:03.000 top country with the highest cases
01:22:10.560 what is
01:22:12.060 what's the answer
01:22:17.159 it's U.S correct
01:22:20.040 that's good
01:22:22.140 next part recovery cases it's the same
01:22:25.260 thing actually
01:22:26.940 um we could just edit this again
01:22:29.580 and then um
01:22:32.699 you use bar chart again
01:22:37.440 and then
01:22:38.880 um should be that um it's just a wrong
01:22:41.640 label not that we're checking the death
01:22:43.260 cases here
01:22:48.540 um bar chart and then measure that yeah
01:22:51.060 that's what that called country region
01:22:53.280 and then top five
01:22:56.940 Grand Country region top five
01:23:01.920 so it is also us
01:23:05.159 but you have different countries here
01:23:07.920 now
01:23:09.780 it's different from this graph because
01:23:11.340 it's for the dead cases
01:23:14.640 should be that
01:23:16.679 this is the
01:23:25.739 and that's it
01:23:29.219 very so far
01:23:36.300 still following
01:23:44.840 okay good we are almost um I think we're
01:23:48.620 uh done in like five to ten minutes
01:23:56.159 so the next part is
01:23:59.400 um more on exploring our data so how do
01:24:02.820 you do that
01:24:05.219 you click this one again we are now here
01:24:07.679 in
01:24:09.000 um stage four the explore mode click
01:24:11.520 data
01:24:23.219 so we can we can explore their data here
01:24:25.739 it's also
01:24:27.179 um creates graphs for you when you're
01:24:28.620 exploring it so let's try total
01:24:31.080 confirmed cases here and click that
01:24:33.840 in total we have 621 million right but
01:24:37.679 what if we want to filter it whatever
01:24:40.199 you only want to check certain countries
01:24:42.719 you click this
01:24:45.480 country region and then select the
01:24:47.699 countries that you want you can search
01:24:49.080 it for example with other communities
01:24:53.520 make sure that you click this make sure
01:24:55.800 that it's highlighted the country region
01:24:58.260 this example if you do this you can use
01:25:00.840 here
01:25:05.520 um you get idea
01:25:07.860 um you add more countries yes Malaysia
01:25:13.860 um
01:25:17.699 then you can add more countries you get
01:25:19.800 an idea
01:25:23.880 you have a boyfriend right here
01:25:26.340 you can change it if you want but the
01:25:28.440 suggested one is part it automatically
01:25:30.260 have determined that this is the best
01:25:33.420 about for this and yes virus and
01:25:36.659 appropriate graph for this
01:25:41.340 that's how you can explore your data you
01:25:43.320 can also export it here
01:25:46.380 copy to new data Explorer mode you can
01:25:48.719 do that
01:25:51.719 and it will automatically go back to
01:25:53.880 your original patient it created that
01:25:55.860 graph here
01:25:57.300 you can drag it actually
01:25:59.100 this is this one actually but unfiltered
01:26:03.360 it's a service
01:26:04.920 that's how you can generate your gaps
01:26:06.900 instead of
01:26:08.400 um bring it like that temporary earlier
01:26:10.620 you can generate it using the data
01:26:12.480 Explorer mode
01:26:16.199 that's one way of doing it
01:26:18.840 then you could just drag it
01:26:20.699 to here kind of tricky actually to drag
01:26:22.980 it
01:26:24.060 but yeah you get the idea
01:26:28.199 I need to turn on creation space here
01:26:30.360 and then transfer it
01:26:32.340 here
01:26:41.040 that's according to explore mode
01:26:43.800 any questions
01:26:51.179 no
01:26:56.639 and we're in the final point
01:26:58.860 styling so styling is open-ended
01:27:03.239 um you do whatever you want to do
01:27:06.300 um so you'll be seeing some graphs here
01:27:09.239 if it doesn't upload then we can just
01:27:11.219 use the ones that we have created
01:27:12.480 earlier
01:27:13.380 it's okay
01:27:16.260 okay so there might be some issues with
01:27:19.739 um the graphs here
01:27:21.360 but basically for this part um you just
01:27:24.659 modify your graphs style it
01:27:27.719 so for example
01:27:29.400 um let's go back here
01:27:31.739 you can actually even copy paste
01:27:34.500 okay you can click that and then
01:27:37.860 we can copy it there
01:27:41.040 copy to
01:27:42.659 styling
01:27:46.320 so it's this graph right let's just
01:27:48.420 modify this one
01:27:51.120 this is really open-ended basically just
01:27:53.219 transfer all your gaps from other Pages
01:27:55.500 put it here for the styling page and
01:27:58.020 then modify it or we do that again go to
01:28:01.500 the sign in that's how you modify it it
01:28:05.340 and then
01:28:06.960 see that it's in Builder mode you have
01:28:09.420 to click this
01:28:10.800 paintbrush this paintbrush here we click
01:28:14.699 that that's the styling mode and then
01:28:17.219 you can now change your background color
01:28:20.219 since Brown now
01:28:22.139 um what if you want to make it red well
01:28:24.540 really up to you it'd be
01:28:27.480 um quite
01:28:29.580 you could change the film color
01:28:31.800 um I don't know let's try this one
01:28:34.679 see it's now um with purple
01:28:37.500 yeah that's how you style things and
01:28:40.139 it's open-ended yeah just play around
01:28:42.179 with it
01:28:43.380 change the colors change the font size
01:28:45.300 change whatever you want
01:28:49.860 any questions
01:28:52.920 because we are done
01:28:57.780 that's
01:28:59.280 pretty much it again you have done
01:29:02.760 um data collection extraction you were
01:29:05.219 able to pre-process it you're able to
01:29:08.400 um get the quick stats and some Auto ml
01:29:11.100 for that data set that we have just
01:29:12.900 pre-processed you're able to create some
01:29:15.600 graphs given that data and then styling
01:29:21.060 foreign
01:29:27.560 I guess
01:29:37.380 type yes
01:30:01.800 okay okay before we end uh we need to
01:30:05.760 answer the survey
01:30:08.580 post email chat and then I'll also share
01:30:11.940 the recording and the link again later
01:30:14.280 so
01:30:15.480 please answer that and I'll send the
01:30:17.520 certificates
01:30:19.199 after you do that
01:30:27.060 I do have LinkedIn yes you may follow me
01:30:31.020 um hold off
01:30:32.699 I wrote Basics here
01:30:42.360 and then there's
01:30:52.820 any questions before we end
01:31:01.199 can okay go Gabriel
01:31:04.500 hi sir this one oh sorry I just wanted
01:31:06.960 to say thank you for like getting up
01:31:09.000 with this one and then setting this up
01:31:11.460 um my question is what best practices
01:31:13.620 would you provide since you're already
01:31:16.139 an ambassador of the asean PSE
01:31:20.100 so like how are we gonna yeah do you
01:31:23.460 have like best practices that you can
01:31:24.960 offer
01:31:25.980 or what
01:31:27.780 are they coming up with the storyboard
01:31:29.460 and everything
01:31:30.780 okay good question um
01:31:33.540 uh find something that you're really
01:31:35.219 passionate about if possible
01:31:38.520 um and then you really have to think
01:31:40.080 about what you wanted to solve that's
01:31:42.360 the first thing
01:31:43.440 uh once that is clear you now have to
01:31:46.500 find a data set that you could use for
01:31:49.500 whatever it is that you wanted to solve
01:31:52.440 it's really important that you come you
01:31:54.480 come up with a very good narrative
01:31:57.780 so find the data that you can to build
01:31:59.639 that narrative
01:32:01.560 um and then eventually
01:32:03.239 um make sure that you're able to
01:32:04.860 communicate it appropriately with the
01:32:06.300 stakeholders so that involves very good
01:32:09.360 visualization skills and um if you are
01:32:12.540 still not that familiar with the nuances
01:32:15.360 of data visualization I suggest that we
01:32:18.179 both database
01:32:20.760 um
01:32:21.780 such data to this website
01:32:25.860 um I will share my screen
01:32:34.800 so if you're not familiar with the
01:32:37.199 nonsense updated this at least you could
01:32:39.300 go to this one and then um it shows you
01:32:42.000 how to select
01:32:45.480 an appropriate graph for your data if
01:32:48.120 you're using a numeric data and it only
01:32:50.040 has one variable then you make use of
01:32:52.560 Instagram or density blog
01:32:54.600 if it's numeric and through numeric
01:32:57.120 variables and it's ordered it should be
01:32:59.520 this kind of this other product line
01:33:01.860 plot three line plots simply the better
01:33:04.639 if it is not ordered and there's a few
01:33:07.380 points you use box plot if there's many
01:33:09.239 points in this violent quantity you get
